Hello! these are all the files I created for the mini project 2 you can't see the xlsx file on github since it'll just say raw data but once you download the file you should be able to see the data.

here is a summary of what each file contains
---------------------------------------------
first_digits.xlsx: file contains a table of 1000 items which are the first digit to each file.

file_sizes.txt: file contains all the sizes (KB) of each file.

Stats_Table_And_Graph.xlsx: contains all the tables and the graphs created

ExtractAllStats.py: is the python script I created to analyze the data, create the table of 1000 items, and does the computations for Benford's Law.
